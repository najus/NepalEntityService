  "description": "Ganesh Man Singh (1915–1997) was a prominent Nepali politician and the supreme commander of the 1990 People's Movement that restored democracy in Nepal. Often called the 'Father of Democracy' and the 'Iron Man' of Nepali politics, he began his political career opposing the autocratic Rana regime as a member of the Praja Parishad. He was a founding leader of the Nepali Congress and a central figure in the 1951 revolution. Singh served as a cabinet minister but was imprisoned for eight years following the 1960 royal coup. After his release, he continued his democratic struggle, eventually leading the successful 1990 movement. He famously declined the offer to become prime minister, recommending his colleague Krishna Prasad Bhattarai instead. Singh received several international accolades for his contributions to peace and human rights, including the UN Human Rights Prize in 1993.",
