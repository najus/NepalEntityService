He was active in the democratic movement against the Panchayat system in the 1980s. During the Maoist civil war, he remained in the political mainstream and served as a mediator. In 2009, his party, Unity Centre, Masal, merged with the CPN (Maoist). Shrestha has held numerous significant government roles, including multiple tenures as Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Minister of Home Affairs. As Home Minister in 2023, he initiated investigations into major corruption cases like the Bhutanese refugee scam and the Lalita Niwas land grab.",
