  "description": "Sunil Babu Pant (born 1971) is a Nepali human rights activist, monk, and former politician. In 2001, he founded the Blue Diamond Society, Nepal's first LGBT organization. His activism was crucial in the 2008 Supreme Court of Nepal decision that recognized a third gender, decriminalized homosexuality, and permitted same-sex marriage. Pant served as a member of the Nepalese Constituent Assembly from 2008 to 2013. In 2020, he ended his political career, converted to Buddhism, and began training as a monk under the name Bhikshu Kashyap. He has also directed a short film titled 'Blue Flower'.",
