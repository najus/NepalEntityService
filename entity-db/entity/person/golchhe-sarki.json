  "description": "Golchhe Sarki was a Nepalese politician from the Dalit community. In 1988, he became the president of the newly formed Utpidit Jatiya Utthan Manch. He was elected to the Pratinidhi Sabha in 1991 as a candidate for the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist). When the CPN(UML) split in 1998, he joined the CPN(ML), and later rejoined the CPN(UML) in 2002. Sarki was expelled from the party on March 14, 2005, for supporting the royal takeover. Subsequently, he was appointed Assistant Minister for Transport Management by King Gyanendra in July 2005, and reshuffled to Assistant Minister for Women, Children and Social Welfare in December 2005. He died on December 29, 2006.",
