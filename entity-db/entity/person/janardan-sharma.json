He has served in multiple ministerial roles, including Finance Minister, Minister of Home Affairs, Minister for Energy, and Minister for Peace and Reconstruction. He is particularly known for his tenure as Energy Minister, during which he significantly reduced Nepal's widespread power outages (loadshedding). In 2022, as Finance Minister, he faced controversy over allegations of improperly changing tax rates, leading to his temporary resignation before being reinstated.",
