  "description": "Krishna Bahadur Mahara is a Nepalese politician affiliated with the Nepal Communist Party (NCP). He was a significant Maoist leader during the Nepalese Civil War. After the peace process began, Mahara was elected to parliament multiple times and held several cabinet positions. He was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives in 2017 but resigned in October 2019 following allegations of attempted rape, of which he was later acquitted in February 2020. He has also been investigated for alleged involvement in a gold smuggling case.",
