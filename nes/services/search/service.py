"""Search Service implementation for nes.

The Search Service provides read-optimized search capabilities:
- Entity text search with multilingual support (Nepali and English)
- Type and subtype filtering
- Attribute-based filtering with AND logic
- Pagination support
- Relationship search with temporal filtering
- Version retrieval for entities and relationships

This service is separate from the Publication Service and focuses on
read operations only. It uses the database layer directly for efficient queries.
