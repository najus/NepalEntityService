"""Relationship integrity checking functions for nes.

This module provides functions for validating relationship integrity:
- Entity existence validation: Ensures both source and target entities exist
- Circular relationship detection: Detects cycles in hierarchical relationships
- Duplicate relationship checking: Identifies duplicate relationships
- Constraint validation: Validates temporal and type constraints

The integrity checks are designed to maintain data quality and prevent
invalid relationship states in the database. Circular relationship detection
only applies to hierarchical relationship types (SUPERVISES, PARENT_OF, CHILD_OF)
to avoid false positives in non-hierarchical relationships like MEMBER_OF.

Example usage:
    from nes.services.publication.integrity import (
        check_circular_relationship,
        find_orphaned_relationships
    )
    
    # Check if a relationship would create a circle
    is_circular = await check_circular_relationship(
        db=database,
        source_entity_id="entity:person/a",
        target_entity_id="entity:person/b",
        relationship_type="SUPERVISES"
    )
    
    # Find all orphaned relationships
    orphaned = await find_orphaned_relationships(db=database)
