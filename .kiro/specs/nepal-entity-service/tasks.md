# Implementation Plan - Complete V2 Rewrite (TDD Approach)

> **IMPORTANT**: This is a complete rewrite in a new `nes2` package with breaking changes. The existing `nes` package will remain untouched during development and will be deleted after v2 is complete. The new database will use `nes-db/v2` instead of `entity-db`.

> **TDD METHODOLOGY**: All implementation tasks follow Red-Green-Refactor. Write failing tests first (Red), implement minimal code to pass (Green), then refactor for quality (Refactor).

> Another note: We use poetry for venv-based development.
