## Introduction

### What is a Maintainer?

Maintainers are trusted individuals who:
- Review migration pull requests for quality and correctness
- Execute approved migrations to update the database
- Manage the Database Repository
- Ensure data integrity and quality
- Monitor CI/CD workflows

### Two-Repository Architecture

The system operates across two repositories:

1. **Service API Repository** (NepalEntityService)
   - Contains application code and migration scripts
   - Contributors submit PRs here
   - Lightweight (~10MB)

2. **Database Repository** (nes-db)
   - Contains entity/relationship JSON files (100k-1M files)
   - Managed as Git submodule at `nes-db/`
   - Large repository (~1GB+)
   - Modified by migration execution

**Key Concept**: Contributors submit migration code to the Service API Repository. Maintainers review and merge the code, then execute migrations which modify files in the Database Repository.

---

## Maintainer Responsibilities

- Ensure multilingual data (English + Nepali)
- Validate entity relationships
- Maintain data consistency

### Execution

- Execute approved migrations
- Monitor migration progress
- Handle failures gracefully
- Commit changes to Database Repository
- Update submodule references

### Documentation

- Ensure migrations are well-documented
- Update guides as needed
- Document troubleshooting solutions
- Maintain migration history

---

## Reviewing Migration Pull Requests

### Step 1: Initial Review

When a migration PR is submitted, check:

**PR Structure**:
- [ ] Migration folder follows naming convention (NNN-descriptive-name)
- [ ] Contains migrate.py with required metadata
- [ ] Contains README.md with documentation
- [ ] Data files are included if needed

**Code Quality**:
- [ ] Migration script has AUTHOR, DATE, DESCRIPTION metadata
- [ ] Implements async `migrate(context)` function
- [ ] Includes error handling
- [ ] Uses appropriate author ID
- [ ] Logs progress messages

**Documentation**:
- [ ] README.md explains purpose clearly
- [ ] Data sources are cited with URLs
- [ ] Changes are documented
- [ ] Dependencies are noted

### Step 2: Data Source Verification

Verify the data sources:

```markdown
## Checklist for Data Sources

- [ ] Sources are credible (government, official records, reputable organizations)
- [ ] URLs are accessible and valid
- [ ] Data matches the source (spot check)
- [ ] Date of data collection is noted
- [ ] Licensing allows use (public domain, open data, etc.)
```

### Step 3: Code Review

Review the migration script:

**Safety Checks**:
```python
# ✓ Good: Checks if entity exists before creating
entity = await context.search.find_entity_by_name(name, type)
if not entity:
    await context.publication.create_entity(...)

# ✗ Bad: Creates without checking (may cause duplicates)
await context.publication.create_entity(...)
```

**Error Handling**:
```python
# ✓ Good: Handles errors gracefully
try:
    await context.publication.create_entity(...)
except Exception as e:
    context.log(f"Failed: {e}")
    # Continue processing

# ✗ Bad: No error handling (migration crashes on first error)
await context.publication.create_entity(...)
```

**Data Quality**:
```python
# ✓ Good: Validates data before processing
if not row.get("name_en") or not row.get("name_ne"):
    context.log(f"Skipping row with missing names: {row}")
    continue

# ✗ Bad: No validation (may create incomplete entities)
entity_data = {"names": [{"en": {"full": row["name_en"]}}]}
```

### Step 4: Local Testing

Test the migration locally before merging:

```bash
# Pull the PR branch
git fetch origin pull/123/head:pr-123
git checkout pr-123

# Update database submodule
git submodule update

# Run migration in dry-run mode
nes migrate run NNN-migration-name --dry-run

# Review output for errors or warnings
```

**What to Check**:
- Migration executes without errors
- Entities are created correctly
- Relationships are valid
- No duplicate entities
- Logs are informative

### Step 5: Request Changes or Approve

**If changes are needed**:
```markdown
Thanks for the contribution! A few items to address:

1. **Data Source**: Please add a URL to the official government source
2. **Error Handling**: Add try/except around entity creation (line 45)
3. **Validation**: Check for empty names before creating entities
4. **Documentation**: Add the date when data was collected

Let me know if you have questions!
```

**If approved**:
```markdown
Looks great! The migration is well-structured and data sources are verified.

I'll merge this and execute the migration.
```

### Step 6: Merge the PR

Once approved:

```bash
# Merge via GitHub UI or command line
git checkout main
git merge pr-123
git push origin main
```

## Executing Migrations

### Step 1: Check Pending Migrations

```bash
# See all pending migrations
nes migrate pending

# Output:
# Pending migrations:
#   005-add-cabinet-ministers
#   006-update-party-leadership
```

### Step 2: Execute Single Migration

```bash
# Run specific migration
nes migrate run 005-add-cabinet-ministers

# Output:
# Running migration: 005-add-cabinet-ministers
# [Migration] Processing 25 entities...
# [Migration] Created 25 entities
# [Migration] Migration completed
# ✓ Migration completed in 12.3s
# ✓ Committed to database repository
# ✓ Pushed to remote
```

**What Happens**:
1. Migration script executes
2. Entities/relationships are created in `nes-db/v2/`
3. Changes are committed to Database Repository with metadata
4. Commit is pushed to remote
5. Submodule reference is updated in Service API Repository

### Step 3: Execute All Pending Migrations

```bash
# Run all pending migrations in order
nes migrate run --all

# Output:
# Running 2 pending migrations...
# 
# [1/2] Running: 005-add-cabinet-ministers
# ✓ Completed in 12.3s
# 
# [2/2] Running: 006-update-party-leadership
# ✓ Completed in 8.7s
# 
# All migrations completed successfully
```

### Step 4: Verify Results

```bash
# Check database repository
cd nes-db
git log -3

# Output:
# commit abc123...
# Author: Migration System
# Date: 2024-03-15
# 
#     Migration: 005-add-cabinet-ministers
#     
#     Import current cabinet ministers from official records
#     
#     Author: contributor@example.com
#     Date: 2024-03-15
#     Entities created: 25
#     Relationships created: 25
#     Duration: 12.3s

# Check created files
ls v2/entity/person/ | tail -5
```

### Step 5: Update Service API Repository

```bash
# Return to main repository
cd ..

# Commit submodule update
git add nes-db
git commit -m "Update database submodule after migration 005"
git push origin main
```

## CI/CD Workflows

The migration system includes two GitHub Actions workflows:

### Migration Preview Workflow

**Trigger**: Pull request to `migrations/` directory

**Purpose**: Preview migration results before merging

**What it does**:
1. Checks out PR branch
2. Runs migrations in isolated environment
3. Generates statistics (entities/relationships created)
4. Posts comment on PR with results

**Example Comment**:
```markdown
## Migration Preview: 005-add-cabinet-ministers

✓ Migration executed successfully

### Statistics
- Entities created: 25
- Relationships created: 25
- Duration: 12.3s

### Logs
[View full logs](https://github.com/.../actions/runs/123)
```

### Migration Persistence Workflow

**Triggers**:
- PR merge to main branch (if migrations/ changed)
- Daily schedule (2 AM UTC)

**Purpose**: Automatically execute pending migrations

**What it does**:
1. Checks for pending migrations
2. Executes pending migrations
3. Commits to Database Repository
4. Pushes to remote
5. Updates submodule reference

**Monitoring**:
```bash
# Check workflow status on GitHub
# https://github.com/NewNepal-org/NepalEntityService/actions

# View workflow logs for details
```

**Manual Trigger**:
```bash
# Trigger workflow manually via GitHub UI
# Actions → Migration Persistence → Run workflow
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Migration Fails with Validation Error

**Symptom**:
```
ValueError: Entity must have at least one name with kind='PRIMARY'
```

**Solution**:
1. Review migration script for data validation
2. Check input data files for missing fields
3. Add validation before entity creation:

```python
if not row.get("name_en"):
    context.log(f"Skipping row with missing name: {row}")
    continue
```

### Issue 2: Duplicate Entity Error

**Symptom**:
```
ValueError: Entity with slug 'ram-sharma' already exists
```

**Solution**:
1. Check if entity exists before creating:

```python
from nes.core.identifiers import build_entity_id

entity_id = build_entity_id("person", None, "ram-sharma")
existing = await context.db.get_entity(entity_id)

if existing:
    # Update instead of create
    await context.publication.update_entity(...)
else:
    await context.publication.create_entity(...)
```

### Issue 3: Migration Already Applied

**Symptom**:
```
Migration already applied, skipping
```

**Explanation**: The migration was already executed and committed to the Database Repository. The system detects the persisted snapshot and skips re-execution.

**Solution**:
- This is expected behavior (ensures determinism)
- To force re-execution (for testing): `nes migrate run --force NNN-name`
- For production, create a new migration instead

### Issue 4: Large Commit Performance

**Symptom**: Migration creates 10,000+ files and Git commit is slow

**Solution**: The system automatically batches commits:

```python
# Automatic batching (no action needed)
# Commits are split into batches of 1000 files each
# Each batch gets its own commit with metadata
```

**Manual Optimization**:
```bash
# Configure Git for large repositories
cd nes-db
git config core.preloadindex true
git config core.fscache true
git config gc.auto 256
```

### Issue 5: Relationship Target Not Found

**Symptom**:
```
ValueError: Target entity 'entity:organization/...' does not exist
```

**Solution**:
1. Verify target entity exists:

```python
target = await context.db.get_entity(target_id)
if not target:
    context.log(f"Target entity not found: {target_id}")
    continue
```

2. Check migration dependencies in README.md
3. Ensure prerequisite migrations are executed first

### Issue 6: Git Push Fails

**Symptom**:
```
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/...'
```

**Solution**:
1. Pull latest changes:

```bash
cd nes-db
git pull origin main
```

2. Resolve conflicts if any
3. Push again:

```bash
git push origin main
```

### Issue 7: Submodule Out of Sync

**Symptom**: Service API repo shows outdated submodule reference

**Solution**:
```bash
# Update submodule to latest
git submodule update --remote nes-db

# Commit the update
git add nes-db
git commit -m "Update database submodule"
git push origin main
```

---

## Database Repository Management

### Cloning for Maintainers

**Full Clone** (for migration execution):
```bash
# Clone with submodules
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/NewNepal-org/NepalEntityService.git
cd NepalEntityService

# This downloads the full database (~1GB+)
```

**Shallow Clone** (for development):
```bash
# Clone with limited history
git clone --depth 1 --recurse-submodules https://github.com/NewNepal-org/NepalEntityService.git
```

### Database Repository Optimization

**For Large Repositories**:
```bash
cd nes-db

# Configure Git for performance
git config core.preloadindex true
git config core.fscache true
git config gc.auto 256
git config pack.threads 4

# Periodic maintenance
git gc --aggressive
```

### Backup Strategy

**Automated Backups**:
- GitHub provides automatic backups
- Git history serves as complete backup
- All changes are versioned and recoverable

**Manual Backup**:
```bash
# Clone database repository
git clone https://github.com/NewNepal-org/NepalEntityService-database.git backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Or create archive
cd nes-db
git archive --format=tar.gz --output=../backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz HEAD
```

### Rollback Procedure

**Rollback Single Migration**:
```bash
cd nes-db

# Find migration commit
git log --grep="Migration: 005-add-cabinet-ministers"

# Revert the commit
git revert <commit-sha>

# Push revert
git push origin main
```

**Rollback Multiple Migrations**:
```bash
# Revert last 3 migrations
git revert HEAD~2..HEAD

# Or reset to specific commit (destructive)
git reset --hard <commit-sha>
git push --force origin main  # Use with caution!
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Review Before Merging

Never merge a migration PR without:
- Local testing
- Data source verification
- Code review
- Documentation check

### 2. Execute Migrations Promptly

- Execute migrations within 24-48 hours of merging
- Don't let pending migrations accumulate
- Monitor CI/CD workflows for automatic execution

### 3. Monitor Database Size

```bash
# Check database size
cd nes-db
du -sh .

# Check entity counts
find v2/entity -type f | wc -l
find v2/relationship -type f | wc -l
```

### 4. Communicate with Contributors

- Provide clear feedback on PRs
- Explain rejection reasons
- Acknowledge good contributions
- Help improve migration quality

### 5. Document Issues

When encountering issues:
- Document the problem and solution
- Update this guide if needed
- Share knowledge with other maintainers

### 6. Regular Maintenance

**Weekly**:
- Review pending migrations
- Check CI/CD workflow status
- Monitor database repository size

**Monthly**:
- Review migration history
- Audit data quality
- Update documentation
- Optimize database repository

### 7. Security Considerations

- Review migration scripts for malicious code
- Verify data sources are legitimate
- Check for sensitive information in data files
- Ensure proper attribution

### 8. Coordinate with Other Maintainers

- Communicate before executing large migrations
- Avoid concurrent migration execution
- Share knowledge and best practices
- Document decisions
