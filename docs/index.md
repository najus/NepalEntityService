Welcome to the **Nepal Entity Service** (NES) documentation. 🇳🇵 NES is an **Open Source, open data, and open API** project that provides a comprehensive platform for managing Nepali public entities including persons, organizations, and locations with full versioning and relationship tracking.

## Open Source • Open Data • Open API

Nepal Entity Service is built on three core principles:

- **🔓 Open Source**: The entire codebase is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/NewNepal-org/NepalEntityService). Anyone can contribute, review, or run their own instance.

- **📊 Open Data**: All entity data is publicly accessible and maintained through transparent, community-driven migrations. Every change is tracked, reviewed, and versioned with complete audit trails. Learn more about [database update workflows](/contributors/workflows).

- **🌐 Open API**: A free, public REST API at [https://nes.newnepal.org/api](https://nes.newnepal.org/api) provides read access to all entity data without authentication. Build applications, conduct research, or integrate with your projects freely.

## What is Nepal Entity Service?

The Nepal Entity Service provides a robust foundation for civic technology applications, built from the ground up with **multilingual support** and a deep commitment to **respecting Nepali culture in software**. The service offers:

- **Structured Entity Management**: Manage persons, organizations, and locations with rich metadata
- **Versioning System**: Complete audit trails for all changes with author attribution
- **Relationship Tracking**: Model complex connections between entities
- **Multilingual Support**: Native support for Nepali (Devanagari) and English, with proper handling of Nepali names, transliteration, and cultural context
- **RESTful API**: Public read-only API for accessing entity data

- **Cultural Authenticity**: Designed to preserve and respect Nepali linguistic and cultural nuances in all aspects of the software

## Key Features

### Entity Management
Manage three types of entities with rich metadata:
- **Persons**: Politicians, public officials, and other public figures
