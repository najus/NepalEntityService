"""Example: Create relationships between entities with automatic versioning.

This example demonstrates how to:
1. Initialize the Publication Service
2. Create relationships between entities (person to organization)
3. Add temporal information (start/end dates)
4. Query relationships for an entity
5. View relationship version history

The example uses authentic Nepali political data.
